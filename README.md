#Amazon Deployment Guide

Best practices for deploying DataStax Enterprise (DSE) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) are covered [here](./bestpractices.md). The [Apache Cassandra on AWS whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Cassandra_on_AWS.pdf) is a great resource for understanding best practices as well.

Amazon Cloud Formation (CFn) templates can be deployed from the [DSE Quickstart](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/datastax-enterprise/), and can simplify complex deployments on AWS. Instructions on their use are available in the [deployment guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-datastax/doc/datastax-enterprise-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf), and the templates themselves are available [here](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-datastax).
