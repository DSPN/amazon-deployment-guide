#Amazon Deployment Guide

Best practices for deploying DataStax Enterprise (DSE) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) are covered [here](./bestpractices.md). The [Apache Cassandra on AWS whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Cassandra_on_AWS.pdf) is a great resource for understanding best practices as well.

DSPN also hosts Amazon Cloud Formation (CFn) templates that can simplify complex deployments on AWS.  CFn templates and instructions on their use are available [here](https://github.com/DSPN/amazon-cloudformation-dse).
